# LAN Server Lab

This repository documents my practical experience setting up, configuring, and maintaining a dedicated LAN server environment. It serves as both a technical reference and a growing lab space for experimenting with networking concepts, server management, and troubleshooting.

The goal is to build a clear, structured record of real-world networking work — from initial setup to advanced diagnostics.
